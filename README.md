# Lost Key Search Algorithm Visualization

This repository contains a comprehensive web-based visualization of various search algorithms used in artificial intelligence. The project models a two-story house as a graph to demonstrate finding a lost key using different search strategies.

## Overview

This interactive visualization demonstrates nine different search algorithms through a step-by-step animated process. The house layout serves as a realistic graph structure where users can observe how different algorithms explore the search space to find a target room.

## Features

### üè† House Layout (Graph Structure)
- **First Floor**: Living Room, Dining Room, Kitchen, Garage, Study Room, Common Room 1, Storage Room, Common Bathroom, Staircase
- **Second Floor**: Master Bedroom, Master Bathroom, Bedroom 1-6, Common Room 2
- **Realistic Connections**: All rooms are connected based on a logical house layout

### üîç Search Algorithms Implemented

#### Uninformed Search Algorithms:
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** - Explores nodes level by level
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)** - Explores as far as possible along each branch
3. **Depth-Limited Search** - DFS with a depth limit of 3
4. **Iterative Deepening Search** - Combines benefits of DFS and BFS
5. **Uniform Cost Search** - Always expands the lowest cost path first
6. **Bidirectional Search** - Searches simultaneously from start and goal

#### Informed Search Algorithms:
7. **A* Search** - Uses heuristic function for optimal pathfinding
8. **Greedy Best-First Search** - Always chooses the node closest to goal
9. **Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*)** - Memory-efficient version of A*

### üé® Visualization Features
- **Real-time Animation**: Step-by-step visual representation of algorithm execution
- **Color-coded States**: 
  - Gray: Default/unvisited nodes
  - Yellow: Currently visiting nodes (with pulse animation)
  - Dark gray: Visited nodes
  - Green: Final path (with glow effect)
  - Red: Goal found (with bounce animation)
- **Interactive Controls**: Dropdown menus for algorithm and room selection
- **Path Highlighting**: Final solution path is clearly marked
- **Algorithm Information**: Real-time status and algorithm-specific details
