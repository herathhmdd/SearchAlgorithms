# Lost Key Search Algorithm Visualization

This repository contains a comprehensive web-based visualization of various search algorithms used in artificial intelligence. The project models a two-story house as a graph to demonstrate finding a lost key using different search strategies.

## Overview

This interactive visualization demonstrates nine different search algorithms through a step-by-step animated process. The house layout serves as a realistic graph structure where users can observe how different algorithms explore the search space to find a target room.

## Features

### üè† House Layout (Graph Structure)
- **First Floor**: Living Room, Dining Room, Kitchen, Garage, Study Room, Common Room 1, Storage Room, Common Bathroom, Staircase
- **Second Floor**: Master Bedroom, Master Bathroom, Bedroom 1-6, Second Floor Living Room (SFLR)
- **Realistic Connections**: All rooms are connected based on a logical house layout with 18 total rooms
- **Visual Layout**: Rooms are positioned to resemble an actual two-story house floor plan

### üîç Search Algorithms Implemented

#### Uninformed Search Algorithms:
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** - Explores nodes level by level
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)** - Explores as far as possible along each branch
3. **Depth-Limited Search** - DFS with a depth limit of 3
4. **Iterative Deepening Search** - Combines benefits of DFS and BFS
5. **Uniform Cost Search** - Always expands the lowest cost path first
6. **Bidirectional Search** - Searches simultaneously from start and goal

#### Informed Search Algorithms:
7. **A* Search** - Uses heuristic function for optimal pathfinding
8. **Greedy Best-First Search** - Always chooses the node closest to goal
9. **Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*)** - Memory-efficient version of A*

### üé® Visualization Features
- **Real-time Animation**: Step-by-step visual representation of algorithm execution
- **Color-coded States**: 
  - Gray: Default/unvisited nodes
  - Yellow: Currently visiting nodes (with pulse animation)
  - Dark gray: Visited nodes
  - Green: Final path (with glow effect)
  - Red: Goal found (with bounce animation)
- **Interactive Controls**: Dropdown menus for algorithm and room selection
- **Path Highlighting**: Final solution path is clearly marked on the graph
- **Final Path Display**: Complete path from start to goal shown with arrow icons (‚Üí) in the Search States section
- **Map Legend**: Visual reference showing room locations and connections
- **Algorithm Information**: Real-time status and algorithm-specific details
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes with scrollable containers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No additional installations required

### Running the Application
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/herathhmdd/SearchAlgorithms.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd SearchAlgorithms
   ```
3. Start a local HTTP server (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8080
   ```
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
5. Alternatively, you can directly open `index.html` in your web browser
6. Select a search algorithm, start room, and goal room
7. Click "Start Search" to begin the visualization
8. Observe the final path displayed in the Search States section with arrow navigation
9. Use "Reset" to clear the visualization and try different configurations

### Usage Instructions
1. **Algorithm Selection**: Choose from 9 different search algorithms using the dropdown menu
2. **Room Selection**: Select any of the 18 rooms as start and goal points (must be different)
3. **Visualization Control**: Click "Start Search" and watch the step-by-step algorithm execution
4. **Path Analysis**: Observe the final path displayed with arrow navigation in the Search States section
5. **Map Reference**: Use the legend on the right to understand room locations and connections
6. **Reset Function**: Clear the current search and try different algorithm/room combinations
7. **Educational Observation**: Compare different algorithms' exploration patterns and path optimality

## Technical Implementation

### Graph Representation
- **Data Structure**: JavaScript object with adjacency list representation
